# Identify-Customer-Segments

In this project, I applied my knowledge of unsupervised learning techniques to identify population segments which form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments are used to direct marketing campaigns towards customers with the highest expected rate of returns.

I applied data cleaning and feature transformation techniques to remove anomalies from the data. Then I applied dimensionality reduction to extract important features and implemented clustering techniques to understand the underlying patterns connecting customers within the same group. 

With this information, I identified potential customers within the segments of the population that are central to increasing the companyâ€™s revenue.

# Identify-Customer-Segments

In this project, I applied my knowledge of unsupervised learning techniques to identify population segments which forms the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments are used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected rate of returns. 

At the end of this project, I was able to make a comparism between the general population and potential customers who identify with segments of the population that are central to the sale's company's base as well as those who are not.

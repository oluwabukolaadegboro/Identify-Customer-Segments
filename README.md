# Identify-Customer-Segments

This also constitutes a part of my Machine Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I applied my knowledge of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify population segments which form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments are used to direct marketing campaigns towards customers with the highest expected rate of returns.

Data cleaning and feature transformation techniques were used to remove anomalies from the data. I also applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to extract important features and implemented clustering techniques such as K-Means to understand the underlying patterns connecting customers within the same group. 

With this information, I identified potential customers within the segments of the population that are central to increasing the companyâ€™s revenue.
